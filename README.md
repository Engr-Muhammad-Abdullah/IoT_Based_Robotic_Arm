Robotic Arms have been used by industries to perform complicated and tedious jobs ever since its introduction in 1962. From assembly lines to paint shops these robotic arms are used extensively in Automotive Manufacturing Industries. Recently with the advancement of technology and advent of Internet of thins (IoT), Robotic arms have also started to plunge in the Medical Applications allowing doctors to perform surgeries remotely by controlling the robotic arm wirelessly. In this project we will build an IoT based Wireless Robotic Arm using NodeMCU.
